# Revenue Optimization through Dynamic Pricing Strategy

This project implements a **dynamic pricing strategy** for BuildMax Rentals, a heavy equipment rental company, to optimize revenue and fleet utilization. Using a **linear programming model**, we analyzed inventory allocation and pricing strategies to balance short- and long-term rentals while maximizing profitability.

The project was developed as part of the *Pricing Analytics* module at Warwick Business School.
